# lapex
LAPEX, short for "LexingAndParsingEXpressions", is a lexer and parser generator written in Rust. 
It can generate lexer and parser code (supporting UTF-8) for LL(1) grammars (LL(k) and LR coming).
The grammar format allows for regex tokens and literal tokens. It also supports the Kleene-Star operator and similar ergonomics.

## Honorable mention
I would like to mention the [palex](https://github.com/Creepsy/palex) project and encourage you to check it out.
